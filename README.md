# Deep-Learning

1. Implementating and Training a neural network from scratch in Python for the MNIST dataset (no PyTorch). (SGD)
      
       The neural network is trained on the Training Set using Stochastic Gradient Descent Algorithm
       
       Foward and Backward Propogation algorithm is used with sigmoid function for nonlinearity
